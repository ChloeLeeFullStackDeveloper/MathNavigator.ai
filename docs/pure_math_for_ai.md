## 📘 What is Pure Mathematics?

Pure Mathematics is the study of mathematical ideas independent of immediate application.  
It includes logic, proof, structure, and abstraction—all of which form the theoretical foundation for modern AI, ML, cryptography, and algorithms.

## 📚 Study Tips for Math Learners in AI

1. **Always connect abstract math to real systems**  
   _Example_: When learning matrix multiplication → visualize how weights combine inputs in a neural network.

2. **Visualize often**  
   Use tools like:
   - [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown) (animations)
   - Desmos / GeoGebra for graphing and linear systems

3. **Code what you learn**  
   Python + NumPy or SymPy is perfect for:
   - Matrix operations
   - Derivatives
   - Combinatorics / probability simulations

4. **Don't skip proofs entirely**  
   While you're focused on application, proof-based exercises sharpen logic and help prevent blind spots.

5. **Keep a learning log**  
   MathNavigator.ai includes a journaling system. Use it to document breakthroughs, questions, and summaries.
